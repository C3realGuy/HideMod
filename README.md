# Hide 2.0

This is the Version 2.0 of the Hide Plugin for [Wedge](http://github.com/wedge/wedge). It adds `[hide]` and `[hide-reply]` BBC to your Forum.

### Features
* Adds `[hide]` BBC. Any Content within this tag can only seen from Members who liked the post
* Adds `[hide-reply]`. Same as with `[hide]` but people have to reply to see the content.
* Adds Buttons for both BBC into the Editor.
* You can't look through the hide (if you're not allowed to) with quotes/search/print page whatever
* Normal members can't dislike posts containing a `[hide]`
* Posts get automatically refreshed if you like them and they contain a `[hide]`
* You have full control over the HTML around the hide tags so you can change the look how you want
* Fully localized (currently english & german translation is available, PR are welcome)
* Permission to look through hide
